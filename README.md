- **Education Section:** Users can enter their degree, school/university, and graduation year.
- **Skills Section:** Users can list their skills in a text area.
- **Work Experience Section:** Users can input their job title, company name, and key responsibilities.

- **Editable Resume:** After generating the resume, users can edit any section of it.
- **Download Resume as PDF:** Users can download their generated resume as a PDF using the `html2pdf.js` library.
- **Shareable Link (Coming Soon):** The app generates a unique URL for each user to share their resume.
